About 90% of german TV\r\nstations have Hbb-TV allready up and running. \r\n\r\nAbout Hbb-TV: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_Broadcast_Broadband_TV\r\n\r\nTechnically Hbb-TV is based on HTTP/HTML/HTML-CE, a web browser \r\nwith some additions for video streaming und IR remote controller handling.\r\nIn the DVB data stream of these TV stations an URL is sent, which \r\nis loaded by this web browser in your TV set.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrivacy ?\r\n---------\r\n\r\nIf Hbb-TV is activated, your TV set sends a web request every time\r\nyou're changing channels. Which means the broadcasting companies \r\ncan monitor exactly when and how long your are watching their channel.\r\nAnd worse, this web pages often include additional statistic features like \r\ngoogle analytics. \r\n\r\nSolution ?\r\n----------\r\n\r\n\"hbb-tv-pp\" is a proxy that filters the requests from your TV set,\r\nreplaces it with it's own menu and takes you in controll when and if\r\nyou want to get web pages from the TV station.\r\n\r\nHOWTO\r\n-----\r\n\r\nYou need a Linux firewall to setup an transparent proxy, \r\nand node.js to run this proxy.\r\n\r\n```\r\n> npm install \r\n> node hpp.js -h\r\nUsage: node hpp.js\r\n\r\n  -l, --bindaddress=ARG  Listen to this IP\r\n  -p, --port=ARG         Listen to this TCP Port (8000)\r\n  -b, --blocklist=ARG    File with Blocklist URLs (Load and Save)\r\n  -m, --mode=ARG         mode at startup: 0=transparent, 1=scanner, 2=privacyproxy (needs -b)\r\n  -h, --help             display this help\r\n\r\n> iptables -t nat -I PREROUTING  -s IP_OF_YOUR_TV_SET -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8000\r\n> node hpp.js -b blocklist.json -m 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn first run you should start hbb-tv-pp in scanner mode, and hop\r\nthrough all your channels. hbb-tv-pp will remember all start pages\r\nfrom your channel list. \r\n\r\nAfter that you can change to privacyproxy mode. In this mode all\r\nstart pages are filtered but the using the red button your can \r\nintentionally open the original hbb-tv content.\r\n\r\nIf you want to start hbb-tv-pp in background at system start consider using \"screen\" or \"forever\"\r\n(http://blog.nodejitsu.com/keep-a-nodejs-server-up-with-forever/). \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
